# Arsenophonus-comparative-genomics
Genome dynamics across the evolutionary transition to endosymbiosis

---

This repository contains data and code for reproducing the analyses from the Arsenophonus comparative genomics project.


- All Arsenophonus genome assemblies (complete and draft) generated during this project can be found in the directory [genome-files](./genome-files).
- The workflow for reproducing the core-genome phylogeny as well as the R script for the tree annotation can be found in the directory [Core-genome phylogeny](./Core-genome%20phylogeny).
- In the directory [Pseudogenes](./Pseudogenes) can be found the workflow for computing the fraction of pseudogenised genes across the Arsenophonus genomes.
- The directory [RSA](./RSA) contains the worklow for reproducing the dNdS analysis and the analysis for relaxation of selection using the [HyPhy](http://hyphy.org/) package.
- The directory [defence](./defence) contains the R script for reproducing the CRISPR spacer-relatedness analysis.
